/* Manage the shutdown process for the comms session.
 *
 * Design:
 * The broker registers a shutdown callback.
 *
 * On receipt of a "shutdown" event, the grace timer is armed, and
 * the broker callback is called with 'expired' false.  The broker
 * should initiate its clean shutdown path.  If the clean shutdown path
 * succeedes, the broker calls shutdown_disarm() to disarm the timer.
 *
 * If the grace timer expires before then, the broker callback
 * is called with 'exipred' true.
