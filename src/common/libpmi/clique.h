 * the process group.  We can ask questions such
 *
 * - which nodeid will launch a given rank?
 * - how many procs will be launched on a given nodeid?
 * - which ranks will be launched on a given nodeid?
 *
 * N.B. due to the fixed PMI KVS value size, and the fact that a process
 * group can be mapped irregularly, some mappings may not be communicable
 * using this attribute.  Therefore, an empty value is to be interpreted
 * as "no mapping available", and should be handled as a non-fatal error.
 *
 * These functions return PMI result codes.
