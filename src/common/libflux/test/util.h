/* Test server - support brokerless testing
 *
 * Start a thread running the user-supplied function 'cb' which
 * is connected back to back to a flux_t handle returned by the
 * create function.  To finalize, call test_server_stop(),
 * followed by flux_close().
 *
 * Caveats:
 * 1) subscribe/unsubscribe requests are not supported
 * 2) all messages are sent with credentials userid=geteuid(), rolemask=OWNER
 * 3) broker attributes (such as rank and size) are unavailable
 * 4) message nodeid is ignored
 *
 * Unit tests that use the test server should call
 * test_server_environment_init() once prior to creating the first server
 * to initialize czmq's runtime.
 *
 * If callback is NULL, a default callback is run that logs each
 * message received with diag().
