-- Set environment specific to Intel MPI
--
-- Intel PMI is an MPICH derivative that bootstraps with the PMI-1 wire
-- protocol, or if I_MPI_PMI_LIBRARY is set, a PMI library.
-- 
-- If the library is set, override it so it points to Flux's.
-- If the library is unset, do nothing.
--
-- (N.B. We could just unconditionally unset it, but that would prevent the
-- user from setting it in order to enable client side PMI tracing in the
-- Flux PMI library, enabled by setting FLUX_PMI_DEBUG=1)
