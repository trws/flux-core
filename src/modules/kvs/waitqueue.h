/* A wait_t represents a waiter, which may be waiting on multiple things.
 * A waitqueue_t represents an object that can can change state and wake up
 * multiple waiters.
 *
 * A wait_t may be added to multiple waitqueue_t's, and multiple wait_t's
 * may be added to a single waitqueue_t.
 *
 * When a wait_t is added to a waitqueue_t, it's usecount is incremented.
 * When one is removed from a waitqueue_t, its usecount is decremented.
 * Once a wait_t's usecount reaches zero, its callback is called and the
 * wait_t is destroyed.
 *
 * When a waitqueue_t is "run", all wait_t's are removed from it.
