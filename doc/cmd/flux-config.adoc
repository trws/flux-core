NAME
----
flux-config - manipulate Flux config file


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux-config* ['--config file'] COMMAND ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
A configuration file is used by the flux(1) command driver
to determine various search paths.

The config file uses the hierarchical ZPL format (see below).
All keys and values are strings.  Hierarchy is expressed with
4-character indentation.  Comments are lines that begin with a "#".

A particular key down in the hierarchy may be specified as a path.
For example "flux-config get /general/exec_path" would print
"/usr/libexec/flux":

  general:
      exec_path = "/usr/libexec/flux"
      cmbd_path = "/usr/bin:/usr/sbin"

This file currently has limited usage in the Flux framework source
trees, as a mechanism for configuring in-tree unit test execution.
It should be considered EXPERIMENTAL and its content subject to change.


OPTIONS
-------
*-c, --config*='FILE'::
Override the default config file path, $HOME/.flux/config.

COMMANDS
--------
*dump* ['path']::
Parse the config file and dump its contents, either the entire file,
or from 'path' on down.

*get* 'path'::
Print the value for 'path'.  Return an error if 'path' does not exist.

*put* 'path=val':
Assign the value 'val' to 'path'.  Any existing value is overwritten.
The config file is created if it does not exist.
