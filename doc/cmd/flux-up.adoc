NAME
----
flux-up - report status of Flux comms broker nodes


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *up* ['--up' | '--down'] ['--comma' | '--newline']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-up(1) reports the status of the nodes in a Flux comms session.
Nodes may be in one of four states: 'ok', 'slow', 'fail', or 'unknown'.

A "node" in this context is an instance of the Flux comms message broker.
Nodes in a session of size N are ranked from 0 to (N - 1), with
rank 0 assigned to the root of the tree-based overlay network.

Each message broker maintains an idle time for its direct overlay children,
reset to zero on any received message, including keepalives generated to
ensure a message rate no less than the session heart rate.  If idle time for
a child reaches a first threshold (default 3 session heartbeats), its state
is changed to 'slow'.  If idle time then progresses to a second threshold
(default 5 session heartbeats), its state is changed to 'fail'.

Once a node reaches the 'fail' state, a failure event is multicast across
the session to notify any children, out of band with respect to the
tree-based overlay network, so they can choose a surrogate parent (normally
a grandparent).  No automated action is taken to replace a failed node.
If a failed node reports in with its parent, its state will change to 'up',
but the overlay network will continue to use the adapted topology.

The algorithm for changing node state and updating the topology is
implemented in the 'live' comms module, which maintains the aggregate
node state in the KVS under the key 'conf.live.status'.  flux-up(1) simply
reads this value from the KVS.

OPTIONS
-------
*-u, --up*::
Print the union of nodes in the 'ok' and 'slow' states.

*-d, --down*::
Print nodes in the 'fail' state.

*-c, --comma*::
Print nodes individually, separated by commas instead abbreviated nodesets.

*-n, --newline*::
Print nodes individually, separated by newlines instead abbreviated nodesets.
