============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux-topo - generate graphviz topology for Flux comms session


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *topo* | dot -Tpng | display


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-topo(1) reads the topology of the Flux comms session tree-based
overlay network from the KVS key 'conf.live.topology' and converts it
to graphviz format on stdout.

Nodes are colored according to their state:  green for 'ok', yellow for
'slow', red for 'fail', and gray for 'unknown'.  See flux-up(1) for a
description of these states.  Graph edges represent communication
channels between nodes.

The topology can be altered at run-time in response to interior nodes
that transition to 'fail' state.  When this happens new ZeroMQ connections
are established but old connections are not dropped, and both will show as
edges in the graph.
