# Usage: flux python drain-undrain.py
#
# Send a drain request immediately followed by an undrain request.
#
# Assumes that the first drain request will be canceled by the undrain request.
# Make sure there is a job in the queue to ensure the drain request does
# not immediately succeed.
#
# Exits with rc=1 if the drain request unexpectedly succeeds.

# Drain the queue.
# Response will not be sent until queue size reaches zero.
f = h.rpc("job-manager.drain")

# Undrain the queue.
# Response is sent after any pending drain requests are canceled.
f2 = h.rpc("job-manager.undrain")

# Receive drain response (expect fail due to cancellation)
